# ParallelTasks
Utility header only library for running tasks in parallel and using their results when finished

This is an attempt to generate something of practial use eventually while learning a bit about asynchronous and functional capabilities of the C++11 standard.

The scope may change but currently this is seeking to parallelly execute a number of tasks, the results of which must be consumed serially.
